Costs
Currently 900k gas for a trade (1 input and 1 output note for each asset)
EIPs have been proposed to reduce it to 200-300k gas; plausibility of these EIPs is unknown.

Questions
Viability of the EIPs for reducing the gas cost of AZTEC transactions
Support for selective disclosure by revealing a blinding key
